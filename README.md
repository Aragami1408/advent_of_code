# Advent of Code Solutions written in Rust
To be frank, I'm not fond of competitive programming, but Advent of Code built different from my perspective.
I used to solve AoC problems using C++ and Python, but now I want to use these problemsets to train my Rust knowledge. 
I'm too lazy to optimize the codes, I fell into the rabbit hole just for fun, and sharpen my logical thinking.
